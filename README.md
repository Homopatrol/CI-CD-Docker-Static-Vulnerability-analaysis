## Prerequisites

Prior to deploying the CI/CD Docker Pipeline you must download or clone this Repository, you can do this by performing:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Homopatrol/secure-Docker-dev-CI-CD-pipeline.git
```

The system that the CI/CD Docker Pipeline will be deployed on requires the following system resources in order to run Code Ready Containers:
   
 - 4 physical CPU cores
 - 9 GB of free memory
 - 35 GB of storage space

## Installing Code Ready Containers

**Note** For Windows installation you must enable Hyper-X from the "Enable/Disable Windows Features" tab.

RedHat provides [this](https://crc.dev/crc/#installing-codeready-containers_gsg) installation guide

### Starting the OpenShift container platform 
After installing Code ready Containers
```console 
crc setup
```

```console 
crc start -c 4 -m 16384
```

The expected output of this command
```console
Started the OpenShift cluster. 

The server is accessible via web console at: 

  https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing 

  
Log in as administrator: 

  Username: kubeadmin 

  Password: <kubeadmin_password>

Log in as user: 

  Username: developer 

  Password: developer 

Use the 'oc' command line interface: 

  PS> & crc oc-env | Invoke-Expression 

  PS> oc login -u developer https://api.crc.testing:6443 
```
You can navigate to the OpenShift web console by navigating to *https://api.crc.testing:6443* or by performing ```console crc console```

If you encounter this error whilst trying to start crc 
```console
failed to expose port :2222 -> 192.168.127.2:22: listen tcp :2222: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions. 
```
**NOTE** The port in this example is *2222* however this solution is applicable to any port number referenced in this error.

You need to disable Hyper-X in Windows Features

Then reserve the port by opening PowerShell with *Administrator* rights and performing
```console 
netsh int ipv4 add excludedportrange protocol=tcp startport=2222 numberofports=1
```

Finally enable Hyper-V and restart your system, then run `crc setup` and `crc start`.


**Note** You must shutdown cluster safetly by performing 
```console
crc stop 
``` 

The expected output is as follows:
```console
INFO Stopping kubelet and all containers... 

INFO Stopping the OpenShift cluster, this may take a few minutes... 

Stopped the OpenShift cluster 
```

## Installing Helm 

```console
# if using Windows ([chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install))
choco install kubernetes-helm

# if using MacOS (brew)
brew install helm

# if using Debian/Ubuntu (APT)
curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https --yes
echo "deb https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install helm
```

### Deploying the DefectDojo Helm chart

Ensure you are in the directory that contains the helm chart by performing:
```console
cd secure-Docker-dev-CI-CD-pipeline-main/Backend/DefectDojo/chart/ 
```

Update the *host* value in DefectDojo's [helm chart](/Backend/DefectDojo/chart/values.yaml). This is the name of the URL that you will assign to your DefectDojo instance.
**NOTE**
If you are using Code Ready Containers the domain for exposed applications is *apps-crc.testing*.
```console
database: postgresql
host: defectdojo-route.app-crc.testing # replace this with your DefectDojo-URL.YourDomain
imagePullPolicy: Always
# Where to pull the defectDojo images from. Defaults to "defectdojo/*" repositories on hub.docker.com
repositoryPrefix: defectdojo
```

```console
helm install <release_name> ./
```
**Note** 
If you are re-installing DefectDojo you must ensure there is no remaning resources from the previous DefectDojo instance.
You can do this by peforming:
```console
oc get pvc

oc delete pvc <release_name>-pvc

----------------------

oc get secret

Name 
------
defectdojo-postgresql-specific
defectdojo-rabbitmq-specific

oc delete secret defectdojo-postgresql-specific defectdojo-rabbitmq-specific
```

All pods should begin starting up 
```console 


```

Once the initializer pod has finished you can access the DefectDojo UI via your specified route, you can retrieve the credentials by navigating to the Secrets tab in Openshift -> <release_name>- 
or by performing 

```console
.
```

### Deploying Gitea Helm chart
Gitea is a self-hosted git service, you can read more about Gitea [here](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/)

Install Gitea from the command line by performing
```console
cd secure-Docker-dev-CI-CD-pipeline-main/Backend/Gitea/chart/ 

helm install <release_name> ./
```

## Installing OpenShift Pipelines


Whilst logged into the OpenShift Web console navigate to the **Operators** tab

### Deploying CI/CD Pipeline Components

Ensure you are deploying the pipeline components in the correct namespace:
```console
oc project openshift-pipelines
```

#### Task
```console
oc create -f kics-task.yaml
oc create -f checkov-task.yaml
```

#### Pipeline
```console
oc create -f Pipeline.yaml
```

#### Secret
Input the API key for the admin user, you can retrieve this whilst logged into the DefectDojo Web UI and navigating to OpenAPIV2 
<img src="https://github.com/Homopatrol/secure-Docker-dev-CI-CD-pipeline/blob/main/Pictures/DD_LoggedIn.jpg">

<img src="https://github.com/Homopatrol/secure-Docker-dev-CI-CD-pipeline/blob/main/Pictures/DD_APIKeyV2.jpg">
```console
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: dojo-secret
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
stringData:
  dojo-secret.username: admin
  dojo-secret.apikey: <>
```

#### ConfigMap
```console
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: dojo-configmap
  namespace: default
data:
  dojo-configmap.url: https://<relrease_name>.yourDomain # e.g https://defectdojo-route.app-crc.testing/
```

#### PipelineResource
```console
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: <resource_name>
spec:
  type: git
  params:
    - name: url
      value: '<url>' # this is the URL of you GitHub Repository 
    - name: revision
      value: main # this is the default revision branch of you repository unless configured otherwise this is main or master.
 ```
 
You can the deploy the PipelineResource by performing:

```console
oc create -f pipelineresouce.yaml
```

#### PipelineRun

## Deploying Tekton Triggers

```console
# Deploy the role based access control
oc create -f rbac.yaml 

# Deploy the trigger template
oc create -f triggertemplate.yaml

# Deploy the trigger binding
oc create  -f triggerbinding.yaml

# Deploy the Eventlistner
oc create -f EventListener.yaml
```

Create a route to the Eventlistner 
```console
oc create route ..
```

### GitHub Webhooks
In the GitHub Repo that you wish to use navigate to Settings > Webhooks and input the Eventlistner URL from above.

## Uninstalling
To uninstall any of the pipeline resources run:

```console
oc delete -f <resource_name>.yaml
```

To uninstall the DefectDojo application run:
```console
helm list



helm uninstall <release_name>
```
